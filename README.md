Codes for arxiv:2410.17721.

The results are shown in notebook Dl_and_Cross_Plots.ipynb, and data are provided in dictionary Dl_data. Main codes are in Codes.

**Modules requirement** : numpy (basic computation), scipy (for interpolation), camb (for CMB data), pytorch (for speeding up with auto-parallel and GPU), matplotlib (for plotting)

My environment is python3.8.19 with numpy=1.21.5, scipy=1.9.3, camb=1.5.4, pytorch=1.10.2, matplotlib=3.5.2. It should work well for higher version pythons for the codes are using just some basic functions.
